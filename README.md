# Laliga
this app is based on Reto2 of programme that i realized with tow colegues A y E 
## ideas that i will add to this project 
- add firstly design patern Factory methode that will facilite adding new users of the app
- make dni primary key instead of user /and the create a fun that generate the password based on (dniName**)/and after first connection ask the user to change it
- i will use the func above to reset password to for admins(if a player forgot his password will ask admin to reset it for him)
- it will b a good idea of i learned about notfications??!! to use it in the tow func above
- i will change the while project tu use files as just (storing tool)/do not do any manipulation of data using directly files
- add admins of teams and Teams-Admin can add or delete coachs of the team
- now that we have an idea about Testing ishould do testing classes to the whole project
- allow user without acounts (visitors) to do some showing info about teams /goals/winers/losers
- ##
- in the futrue add avility to genrate a random maches teams Vs team for the whole LaLiga sesion
- and other func to do random winner golaer to simulate the real word/(other option will be to ask admin to write results of maches of every week )
- simulat the real order of equipes based on points(that he earned)
